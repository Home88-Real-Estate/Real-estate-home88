-- The CRM reaches the database only through Prisma, as the table owner.
-- On Supabase the public schema is also served by its REST/GraphQL API to
-- the "anon" and "authenticated" roles (the publishable key). Lock every
-- table so that API can read or change nothing: RLS on with no policies,
-- and no table privileges for those roles. Guarded so plain PostgreSQL
-- (local development) without those roles runs this too.
